A simple angular front-end for our kitten API.

To try out:
* clone this repo
* cd into the directory
* python -m SimpleHTTPServer
* point browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

You should be able to add kittens by entering their details in the form.
You should be able to filter the display of kittens by typing in the filter box. The filter does a simple string match on the name and breed name fields of the cat objects.
